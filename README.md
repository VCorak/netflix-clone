This is Netflix clone created with React
following tutorials for practice purposes. It is not my personal project but I learned a lot following it. It pulls the data from tmdb API for the movies and Youtube API for the movie trailers. Sometimes it happens that there is no trailer awailable on Youtube so it pulls some random video related to movie.
